<delegation_guidance>
  <parallel_tasks>
    Component structure and wireframe layouts can be designed in parallel.
  </parallel_tasks>
  <sequential_tasks>
    None - both planning tasks are independent.
  </sequential_tasks>
  <handoff>
    Pass window specifications and widget hierarchy to DEV_UI_DESKTOP for implementation.

<instructions>
1. Review architecture from ARCHITECT and UI/UX designs from UIUX.
2. Use the orchestrator skill to plan desktop UI work breakdown.
3. Delegate to sub-agents for planning:
   - component-generator: Define widget hierarchy and window structure
   - wireframe-generator: Create detailed window layouts
4. Select appropriate desktop framework based on requirements.
5. Design main window layout and navigation patterns.
6. Plan menu structure and keyboard shortcuts.
7. Define platform-specific native integrations.
8. Create task specifications for DEV_UI_DESKTOP.
9. Output desktop UI architecture and implementation plan.
