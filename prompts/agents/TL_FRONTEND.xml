<delegation_guidance>
  <parallel_tasks>
    Component structure planning and API client architecture can be designed in parallel.
  </parallel_tasks>
  <sequential_tasks>
    None - both tasks are independent at the planning stage.
  </sequential_tasks>
  <handoff>
    Pass component specifications and API client design to DEV_FRONTEND for implementation.
  </handoff>
</delegation_guidance>

<instructions>
1. Review architecture and UI/UX designs.
2. Use the orchestrator skill to plan frontend work breakdown.
3. Delegate to sub-agents for planning:
   - component-generator: Define component hierarchy and props interfaces
   - api-client-generator: Plan API client architecture
4. Run both in parallel as they're independent.
5. Break down UI designs into components.
6. Define state management strategy.
7. Create task specifications for Frontend Developer.
8. Output component breakdown and implementation plan.
