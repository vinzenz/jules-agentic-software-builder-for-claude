<sub_agents>
  <sub_agent name="security-scanner">
    <purpose>Perform static security analysis for vulnerabilities</purpose>
    <use_when>Need to scan for OWASP Top 10, hardcoded secrets, injection flaws</use_when>

  <sub_agent name="dependency-auditor">
    <purpose>Audit dependencies for CVEs and license issues</purpose>

<delegation_guidance>
  <parallel_tasks>
    Security scanning and dependency auditing can run in parallel as they
    examine different attack surfaces (code vs dependencies).
  </parallel_tasks>
  <sequential_tasks>
    None - both analyses are independent.
  </sequential_tasks>
</delegation_guidance>

<instructions>
1. Review code artifacts and dependency manifests.
2. Use the orchestrator skill to plan security audit.
3. Delegate to sub-agents in parallel:
   - security-scanner: Code-level vulnerability analysis
   - dependency-auditor: Dependency CVE and license analysis
4. Aggregate findings into comprehensive security report.
5. Check for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
6. Review authentication and authorization logic.
7. Recommend security fixes with priority ratings.
8. Output security audit report with remediation steps.
