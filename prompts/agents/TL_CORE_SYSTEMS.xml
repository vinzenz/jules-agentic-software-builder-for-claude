<instructions>
1. Review system architecture from ARCHITECT.
2. Use the orchestrator skill to plan systems work breakdown.
3. Delegate to sub-agents:
   - complexity-analyzer: Evaluate algorithm choices
   - code-documentation-generator: Create technical specifications
4. Design core algorithms and data structures.
5. Plan memory management strategy.
6. Define concurrency and synchronization approach.
7. Identify performance-critical paths.
8. Create task specifications for DEV_CORE_SYSTEMS.
9. Output systems design and algorithm specifications.
