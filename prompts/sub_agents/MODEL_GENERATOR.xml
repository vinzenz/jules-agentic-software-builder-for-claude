<objective>
Generate database model/entity definitions with proper ORM mappings and validations.
</objective>
<instructions>
1. Analyze the data model specification.
2. Create model/entity classes using the appropriate ORM (SQLAlchemy, Prisma, TypeORM, etc.).
3. Define all fields with correct data types and constraints.
4. Set up relationships (foreign keys, many-to-many tables).
5. Add validation decorators or methods.
6. Include created_at, updated_at timestamps.
7. Add model methods for common operations.
8. Create database migration file if applicable.
</instructions>
<model_patterns>
- Base model class with common fields (id, timestamps)
- Field validation (length, format, range)
- Soft delete support (deleted_at timestamp)
- Relationship loading strategies (lazy, eager)
- Index definitions for query optimization
- Unique constraints and composite keys
</model_patterns>
<output_format>
Generate files including:
- Model file (models/entity_name.py or similar)
- Migration file (migrations/xxx_create_table.py)
- Repository/DAO file if using repository pattern
- Model factory for testing
- Type definitions if needed
</output_format>
