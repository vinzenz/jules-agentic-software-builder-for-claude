<objective>
Estimate project complexity, effort distribution, and identify scope boundaries.
</objective>
<instructions>
1. Analyze the requirements and break them into estimable work items.
2. Classify complexity for each work item (Simple/Medium/Complex).
3. Identify core scope vs. nice-to-have features.
4. Define clear scope boundaries and out-of-scope items.
5. Estimate relative effort distribution across components (frontend, backend, infrastructure).
6. Identify potential scope creep risks.
7. Output a scope document with clear boundaries.
</instructions>
<complexity_criteria>
- Simple: Well-understood, minimal dependencies, standard patterns
- Medium: Some complexity, moderate dependencies, some custom logic
- Complex: High uncertainty, multiple dependencies, novel solutions needed
</complexity_criteria>
<output_format>
Create a scope document including:
- In-Scope Features (with complexity ratings)
- Out-of-Scope Items (explicitly excluded)
- Effort Distribution (percentage by area)
- MVP vs. Full Scope Definition
- Scope Change Risks
